## USAGE
The project directory contains a single Python program 'main.py' (located at the bottom of the directory) as well as several .txt files that will be used for testing.

To run the program:

1- Launch the command prompt (e.g., CMD on Windows).

2- Navigate to the project directory using the cd command.

3- Type the following command in the command prompt: 
```python3 main.py <h_xxx> solution``` (where xxx represents the number of the graph you want to study).WARNING: Ensure that the <h_xxx> files are in the same directory as main.py!

To view the result, open the 'solution.txt' file that was created as a result of running the program.

NOTE: The graph 'h_199' could not be added to the GIT repository due to its size exceeding 25MB.
